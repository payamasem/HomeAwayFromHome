# HomeAwayFromHome

### Purpose:
Since all of the developers on our team are from very different cultures, we decided to design an app that allows every individual to feel close to home even when they’re miles and miles away. In order to do that, we wanted to provide a solution to finding a new area to live in, based on the things that each individual user finds most important. We provide detailed information about neighborhoods (including but not limited to: average rent, walk scores, home listings, etc.) Our hope is to give every individual the opportunity to access important information that is necessary to consider when making a new move. We are currently based in the Bay Area (more specifically Berkeley), but we plan to expand across neighborhoods throughout the country in future versions. We have made Home Away from Home a totally free website --- users can get information without logging in or registering an account. 


### How to use it:
1. Initially click on a neighborhood primarily based on map location and rent prices (based on average rent of 1 bedroom apartments).
2. After clicking on a neighborhood from the image map, users will be redirected to an information page about that neighborhood. If they do not want to use the map provided, they can also access the neighborhood pages through the drop-down navigation bar.
3. On the neighborhood info pages, users will be given specific data on their selected neighborhood. They will get various bits of information from the following: Wikipedia API, Walk Score API, and Google Places API.
4. After doing some research on that neighborhood, users can directly search for properties (for both sale and rent) through the Zillow widget at the bottom of the page.
5. Last but not least, users can navigate to the feedback page to let us know exactly what they like about our website, while also informing us on what we can do better in future versions. The comments from the form are stored in a Firebase database and prior feedback from other users is posted underneath the form.
